# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to loose equality (`==`) when checking for `null` or `undefined` values.

## The Problem

The provided code uses loose equality (`==`) to check if arguments `a` and `b` are `null`. While this might seem correct at first glance, it has a subtle flaw.  Loose equality performs type coercion, meaning that values like `0`, an empty string (`""`), and `false` are also considered 'falsy' values.  Therefore, if either `a` or `b` is one of these values, the function will return prematurely, potentially leading to incorrect results.

## The Solution

To fix this, we should use strict equality (`===`) to check for `null` explicitly. Strict equality does not perform type coercion, ensuring that the check is accurate.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3.Observe the unexpected behavior when passing 0, "", and false as arguments.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` and observe the corrected output.
